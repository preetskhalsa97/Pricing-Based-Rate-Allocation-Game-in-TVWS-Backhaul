Acknowledgement: <br>
Dr. Vinay Chamola (BITS Pilani) for the guidance <br>
Dr. Abhirup Das Barman for clarification on the paper<br>
<br>
NOTE: <br>
Formula 12 in the paper gives threshold prices in unit/bps and NOT in unit/Mbps, that might as well be the bottleneck in your implementation. <br>
<br>
Running the simulation: <br>
run simulation.py <br>
Output:<br>
Line1: x- axis values of all the particles initiated for finding optimal price offered by the CBS for a given k- value (change ki_array to find values for different k-values)<br>
Line2: respective utility value of all the particles at the end of all iterations<br>
